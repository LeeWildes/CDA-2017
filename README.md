# CDA-2017

In this project, you are asked to write the core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM using C language on a Unix or a PC platform. Your MySPIM will demonstrate some functions of MIPS processor as well as the principle of the datapath and the control signals of MIPS processor. The MySPIM simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS does cycle-by-cycle. You are required to implement the MySPIM with a single-cycle datapath. You are asked to fill in the body of several functions in a given file. Lee
